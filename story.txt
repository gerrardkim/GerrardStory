There is a guy who wants to go to a Western Pub. His name is topher. But, he is under age. Luckily he has an extremely high quality counterfeit ID. He goes to the bartender, hands over his ID, and asks the bartender for some beer. This is his first time to drink the alcohol. It is really not good. The taste is far from what he imagined. He is drank.

When he got back to his dorm, he was REALLY drank. He started to not feel well so he went to the bathroom. Unfortunately, he ran into his RA on the way there. She could see that there was definitely something wrong with him.
