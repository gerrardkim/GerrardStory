There is a guy who wants to go to a Western Pub. His name is topher. But, he is under age. Luckily he has an extremely high quality counterfeit ID. He goes to the bartender, hands over his ID, and asks the bartender for some beer. This is his first time to drink the alcohol. It is really not good. The taste is far from what he imagined. He is drank.

Even though he did not like the taste, his friends pushed him to continue drinking more and more beer. He wanted to sem cool and fit in with
his new group of friends so he obliged and continued drinking. Before he knew it he was slurring his words and could barely stand up straight.
